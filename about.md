Welcome to my personal tech blog!

My name is John Wostenberg and I write F# and
.NET for work and for play. I am a fourth-year Computer Science and Theatre Arts
major at Benedictine College, KS, USA. I am an active OSS contributor, having [proposed][my-proposals], [designed][my-rfcs], and [implemented][my-prs] some F# language features in the compiler (for example, I was responsible for the [`match!`][match-bang-pr] keyword). I like to frequent the [F# Software Foundation][fssf] slack channel, as well as the F# language design repositories, so if you see me there, stop by and say hello! I've had programming work (internships and freelancing) since my sophomore year of high school. I work on the .NET stack, having had jobs in both C# and, when I'm lucky -- this summer of 2020 being one such fortunate time -- in F#.

I am all for civilized and intelligent discussion. If you ever have any thoughts and/or want to strike up a conversation, feel free to create an issue at [the Github repo](https://github.com/jwosty/jwosty.github.io/issues). Let's talk! No trolls or spam, though, please.
